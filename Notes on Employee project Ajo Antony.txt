1. Employee is a sample project created for learning and experimenting VisualStudio 2019 and .net Core 3.1
2. To open the soulution click on the Employee.sln from the Employee.Web folder inside the Employee folder
3. Web application project is mainly consuming the functionalites from the dependent projects for accessing data from SQL DB and In memory.
4. Opening the solution will open all the dependent projects.
5. Applicaton is using Local Sql DB the connection string for the same is mentioned in the appSetting.Json
6. To interact with the DB the application is making use of Entity Framework Core
7. The Migrations for the DB is with the Employee.DAL project
8. Many of the code written as part of testing is not removed and is commented in the application
9. The way in which I used to test the application is by entring the Cotroller/Action in the url once the localhost is up.
10. The code is not cleaned up as I am continuing with the 'what is new in VS 2019' especially in changes related to middlewares. So the unused namespaces and commented codes are still there.
11. As this is a personal project created only for the purpose of learning and experimenting latest changes with VS, attention was not much on the coding standards and optimizations, but mainly on identifying the changes and learning the latest.
